MythicFATE
==========

Command line tool that simulates dice rolls for **FATE RPG** and **Mythic Game Master Emulator**

This tool is pretty useless without access to the rules of both FATE RPG (http://www.faterpg.com/) and
Mythic Game Master Emulator (http://www.mythic.wordpr.com/page14/page9/page9.html).

It's a command line tool that
* rolls 4 FATE dice and outputs the results (e.g. [+][-][ ][+])
* answers a MythicGME yes/no question given an odds and a chaos rank
* creates a random MythicGME event with context, action, and subject
